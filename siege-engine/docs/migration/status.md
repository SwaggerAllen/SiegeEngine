# Migration status (snapshot, 2026-05-18)

Branch: `claude/fix-queue-job-ordering-pzz20`

The full plan lives outside the repo at
`/root/.claude/plans/pure-crafting-marshmallow.md`. This file is the
in-repo snapshot of what's landed and what's pending so future
sessions can orient without re-reading the planning conversation.

## Phase 0 — Schema freeze + plugin scaffold ✅ LANDED

- `docs/migration/state-schema.md` — state JSON schema v1 + path
  layout + batches/cohorts + idempotency
- `docs/migration/mcp-surface.md` — read-only tool surface
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — manifest pointing at the (not-yet-
  deployed) MCP server URL
- `.claude-plugin/skills/draft-feature-expansion/SKILL.md` — initial
  stub (regenerated from template in Phases 1+2)

Gate not yet passed: the plugin install + MCP transport need to be
verified on mobile CC. That's a real-world test, not a unit test.

## Phase 1 — Bootstrap vertical substrate ✅ LANDED (code, not validated)

`siege-engine/siege_mcp/` — full Python package, 16/16 smoke tests
pass, ruff clean, ruff format clean.

- `state.py` — typed state JSON with load / dump / sha256 / nonce
- `git_view.py` — per-(project, ref, head_sha) snapshot with
  fetch-debounced clone wrapper and lazy body loading
- `fragments.py` — `FragmentKind` enum ported verbatim + new
  body-section parser
- `parsers/{xml_sections,review_xml}.py` — ported verbatim
- `tiers/_base.py` + 7 per-tier modules — generation + review
  context readers for all tiers
- `review_summary.py` + `structure.py` — aggregations matching
  the existing frontend panels' shape
- `validate.py` — pre-commit validation gate (cheap section-presence
  check; the 4K-line per-tier validators from
  `backend/graph/parsers/validators.py` aren't yet ported)
- `tools.py` — MCP tool functions (9 read tools)
- `server.py` — FastAPI app with `/api/*` (HTTP) + `/mcp` (JSON-RPC)
  transports against the same tool surface, bearer JWT auth
- `auth.py` — simplified JWT (ported from `backend/auth/service.py`)
- `cli.py` — writer-side CLI: `write-draft` / `write-review` /
  `write-approval` / `repair-drift` / `mint-batch` / `mint-nonce`.
  Skills invoke this via Bash to materialize state JSON without
  hand-writing it.
- `tests/test_smoke.py` + `test_cli.py` — 16 tests covering state
  round-trip, body section parse, review XML parse, scope paths,
  validate gate, CLI write paths (draft → review → approval),
  drift repair, batch mint, sub-tier paths.

## Phase 2 — Downstream tiers ✅ LANDED (same caveat)

The substrate already covers all 7 tiers — Phase 1 and Phase 2 share
the same `siege_mcp/tiers/` directory because the per-tier reader
pattern was uniform enough that splitting them into separate phases
of work was artificial. The bootstrap-vs-downstream distinction lives
in the slash commands (`/scaffold` is upstream-only, `/run_tier`
handles any tier).

`.claude-plugin/`:

- `skills/` — 25 skills:
  - 21 per-tier (draft / review / regen-with-feedback × 7 tiers)
  - 4 shared (mark-drafted, mark-reviewed, mark-approved,
    repair-state-drift)
- `agents/` — 7 per-tier generator subagents for fan-out
- `commands/` — `/scaffold`, `/run_tier`, `/regen_below`,
  `/continue`, `/status`

Per-tier skills reference the writer CLI inline so the steps the
skill takes are concrete (not abstract pseudocode).

## Phase 3 — Frontend retarget 🟡 IN PROGRESS

The frontend retarget agent is still running at the time of this
writeup. Confirmed landed (from `git log`):

- Deleted: `api/jobs.ts`, queue panels, `useProjectEventStream`,
  `useQueueQueries`, etc.
- Stripped SSE mount from `ProjectWorkspacePage`.
- Added `BranchSelector` + `RefProvider` + `useSelectedRef`.
- Added `useRefs(projectId)` hook stub-pointed at the future MCP
  endpoint.
- Annotated read API modules with future MCP endpoint targets.

Mid-edit when this writeup was taken: `BootstrapDraftPanel.tsx`
(cutting action-triggering buttons). The agent's final report will
list any blockers it hit.

## Phase 4 — Deletion sweep ⏸ NOT EXECUTED

See `docs/migration/deletion-inventory.md` for the punch list.

Deletion is deferred until:

1. MCP server deployed and accepting reads from the dashboard.
2. Plugin installed on mobile CC; one full chain cycle completed.
3. Dashboard fully repointed for ≥ 1 session with no fallback to
   the old backend.

The inventory doc names every file slated for deletion. ~30K LOC out,
~3.5K LOC stays in `backend/` (project CRUD, auth login, git_manager,
github OAuth, config).

## Phase 5 — Optional polish ⏸ NOT STARTED

Deferred per plan:

- Merge-conflict retry on push (multi-writer)
- Repair skills beyond `repair-state-drift`
- CI validators running `verify_dep_graph(ref)` on PRs

## Verification commands

```
# Backend smoke
cd siege-engine
.venv/bin/python -m pytest siege_mcp/tests/ -q
ruff check siege_mcp && ruff format --check siege_mcp

# Frontend (separate)
cd frontend
npx tsc -b --noEmit --force
npx vitest run
npm run lint
npx vite build
```

## Next gates (in order)

1. Deploy `siege_mcp.server:app` to the production host alongside
   the existing FastAPI app.
2. Verify `/plugin install swaggerallen/siegeengine` works on mobile
   CC; load the stub skill, list available MCP tools.
3. End-to-end one project: `/scaffold` from CC on a small test
   repo, observe state JSON + body commits, verify dashboard renders.
4. Then Phase 3 polish + Phase 4 deletion.
